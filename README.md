**Neos - Front End Developer Test**

Candidate:**Alfonso Florio**

Working url: **http://neostest.crystal-bits.co.uk**

Tested with: **Chrome and Firefox**

This "prototype" has been developer with Angular 1.5 and Angular material.
All the requirements have been met. Except for the confirm dialogs I have covered almost all the possible scenarios.

There may still be little glitches but the overall execution seems quite smooth.

I hope you can feel in this execution the same passion I demonstrated during the phone interview.


It is the fruit of 1 day of work. While there is room for improvement I am quite happy of the UI. I have kept the styling at minimum, "less is more".

It has been developed "mobile first" with a sidebar for the category management. It becomes fixed when the screen witdh > 960px;

The tweets are retrieved by a PHP proxy using application-type oAuth. No sensitive information is contained within the Angular project.

There are no routes, everything is kept within the same screen sharing data between different kind of content boxes.

I have also tried some simple animation for the list-items, unfortunately due to time restraint the result is not satisfactory and I have commented the code.

All the steps of the application bootstrapping happens within the files index.*.js 

I have created 2 different kind of services:
 
**Tweets** stores the search risults from the twitter api 

**CatTweets** stores the tweets categorized by the user.

I have also created some simple filters to format the single tweet on screen.

The directive **EnterKey** checks for keypress and trigger the search.

All the user interation is kept within **main/main.controller.js**
